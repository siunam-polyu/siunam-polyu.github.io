# COMP3421 Project

## Simple Weather App

This weather application fetches real-time weather information from public APIs, such as HK Observatory and Open-meteo, and displays it on a web page. Users can search for weather in different cities.

## How to Setup

Since this application is purely static, you can host this application with a simple web server, such as the following:

```bash
> python3 -m http.server 8000
```

In our case, we hosted this application on GitHub Pages.
